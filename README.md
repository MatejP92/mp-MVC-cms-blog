a Blog CMS made in MVC pattern
<hr>
A simple blog content management system where a registered user can write a blog, which is then approved (published) by an admin to be displayed on the website. A registered user has access to the Dashboard, where he can see all his blogs (published and unpublished) in a table, and can edit or delete them.
The admin has access to the Admin Dashboard, where you can see in a table the blogs of all the users that he deletes or edits. He also has access to the table of all registered users, where he can change the user's status (subscriber or admin) or delete them.
This project is made without frameworks from scratch (vanilla php).
